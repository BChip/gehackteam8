==================
* Merge PR removing clearfix
* Merge PR adding dash line options
* style changes for dash line to match spec
* added --px-register-series-marker-width so devs can control thickness of register markers

v1.1.14
==================
* ensure x Axis unit is still displayed in register when value is 0

v1.1.13
==================
* ensure spaces in register item are always consistent

v1.1.12
==================
* fix check for properties on object to check for array before checking all keys
* refactor progressive rendering
* fix missing space in register item after vulcanization

v1.1.11
==================
* ensure tooltip can still be shown in events
* added more config to `eventsConfig`:
      - `firstDateTimeFormat`: moment.js format string for the first part of the timestamp if the x Axis is time based
      - `separator`: the separator character between the two datetime strings
      - `secondDateTimeFormat`: moment.js format string for the second part of the timestamp if the x Axis is time based
      - `tooltipOrientation`: orientation of the tooltip
      - `timezone`: the moment.js timezone to be used for the timestamp

v1.1.10
==================
* added 'enableTooltip' (on by default) to eventConfig

v1.1.9
==================
* Ensure zoom in and zoom out features take the selection type into account

v1.1.8
==================
* Allows data converter to have a interpolator passed in.
* Changes to completeSeriesConfig computation so it does a proper deep clone of seriesConfig to allow functions and special values to be passed in.

v1.1.7
==================
* make sure radial gridline radius can't be negative

v1.1.6
==================
* fixed scale searching for extents. Added check so 0 values passes the filter.

v1.1.5
==================
* removed cleanOnDetached property and mae all elements always clean on detached. This has proven to be a necessary change to avoid unforeseen consequences of notc cleaning up with the config and/or data changing
* bug fix for line with seriesID

v1.1.4
==================
* fixed issue with tooltip on common axis

v1.1.3
==================
* fixed theming issue on dark tooltip

* added font to measureText

v1.1.2
==================
* Added check to scatter checkign scatterDots defined before running isIdInMuted.
* Fixed typo in scatter props

v1.1.1
==================
* Fixed axis unit empty string doesnt clear previous unit

v1.1.0
==================
* Fixed line drawing from 0,0 if start of data is empty. Now leaves a break until first valid data
* Updated to use px-d3-imports
* Fixed gridline demo
* Made thresholds dynamic
* Performance improvements on thresholds
* Added area component
* Added disableClick for register
* fixed bug where deleted axis still draws
* Added isAttached behavior to track if we are attached to detached from dom
* Updates to demo dark theme
* added px-vis-scatter-canvas for supporting scatter on canvas rather than svg. dramatically faster on IE (always), faster on other browsers for big dataset, similar for other browsers for small datasets (<5k points)
* px-vis-chart-navigator now supports canvas rendering
* progressive rendering now can be customized through progressiveRenderingPointsPerFrame (16000 by default for lines, 2000 byy default for scatter) and progressiveRenderingMinimumFrames. Increase progressiveRenderingPointsPerFrame for better performance and decrease for smoother drawing. When at the right value no performance cost incurs and drawing is smooth but if value is too small can incur a performance cost (i.e the drawing will take longer, but will always start at the same time, also the UI won't be frozen)
* fix issue where progressive rendering could miss 1 point per frame, potentially a lot for big dataset
* added cleanOnDetached to allow reuse of the chart after detaching it from the dom. This is aimed at applications creating charts dynamically so that they can keep a pool of charts (simple array of charts) when removing them from the dom and reusing them later on with new data and config, improving performance . Turning cleanOnDetached on will make sure the chart will clear everything needed so that it draws properly with any new config. If using this strategy one thing to keep in mind is making sure the chart is re-appended in the dom *before* changing its properties to their new values. In most cases it would work even if appending it after, but some edge cases scenarios might fail to clean some visual artifact (for example switching from canvas to svg while deleting a few series at the same time). When moving the chart around the dom do not turn it on for performance boost and making sure you don't need the chart to force redrawing. This can be changed dynamically
* ensure canvas and svg clean themselves up on detached (they will redraw on attached if needed)
* ensure gridlines will redraw when moving/removing a chart in/from the dom
* added px-vis-line-svg-rendering-ended and px-vis-scatter-rendering-ended events
* made auto resize debounce timing 250ms by default for every chart (from 50 or 100). Exposed the timing through debounceResizeTiming
* ensure that dynamically switching between svg and canvas rendering cleans the previous drawing
* Fixed demos to support dark theme
* Added bar / column component.
* Fix to behavior scale to work with chartExtents but improper dataExtents
* Fix to behavior scale for dataExtents with ordinal values

==================
* Fixed multi axis dragging position on Safari and IE 11

* Scale and axis changes:

  * Moved Scale into a behavior
  * scale now a simple wrapper around behavior
* Greatly improved and simplified how chart extents are calculated:
  * chartExtents are now only dev set

  * scale will use chartExtents directly and fallback on dataExtents if not present. If neither, then looks through data.
  * defaultSeriesConfig no longer has default min and maxes

* Demo Updates:
  * updated demos with v1 changes
  * all subcomponents have an API Documentation page
* Added navigatorConfig and ability to configure chart navigator with it
* most px-vis components now only loads basic colors as opposed to basic colors + dataVis colors
* Register Changes:
  * Added margin to register height calculation
* Tooltip Changes:
  * Added auto-calculated groupings to tooltip based on number of series. Can be overwritten by devs
* Added checks to gridline to ensure it gets the svg height and number-izes margins
* completeSeriesConfig function will now complete and create an empty completeSeriesConfig if an empty seriesConfig is passed in. Allows the deletion of all series from the chart.
* Ensure tooltip calculation are done based on pixel coordinates rather than values for non-time based charts
* Added px-vis-dynamic-menu in register, allowing developers to pass in custom features/function available in a menu in the register through dynamicMenuConfig
* Added actionConfig to px-vis-interaction-space, allowing to define custom interaction on chart hover or click for example
* Added panning capability to px-vis-interaction-space. Please note that when panning a chart with ordinal axes it is not possible to pan past those axes.
* Added panning capability to px-vis-interaction-space
* Enabled top and right axes
* Events
  * Fixed event clip path to respect a right axis

    * a function run on click
    * an actionConfig used by px-vis-interaction space, allowing interactions on chart hover and click for example
    * an icon
    * a set of sub items which will be displayed in the "secondary" toolbar below when the item is clicked
  * Default actions of "zoom", "pan" and "tooltip" can be passed directly in the config
  * Custom defined functions can also be used in the actionConfig
* Removed px-vis-zoom and provide the PxVisBehaviorChart.zooming behavior for charts instead
* Added 'zoom in' and 'zoom out' buttons in zoom controls
* changing ghp.sh to account for Alpha releases
After BETA
